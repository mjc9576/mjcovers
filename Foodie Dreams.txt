No, no, no, no 

I still see Caseoh inside my room 

Can’t take back the big back he gave me 
It's to the point where I love then I ate him 
And I can’t escape him, so I must replace him (oh) 
Easier said than done 
He tried to do jumping jacks 
Listening to my chest instead of my head 
He ate another one, but 
I am the better one 
I won't let him consume me

He left me falling and landing inside a Wendy’s 
I know that he wants me thicc 
I take Mc Donald’s to make me feel a-okay 
I know it's all in my chest 

I have these foodie dreams where I can't move a thing 
Thinking of food in my bed 
Food is my everything 
Thoughts of an onion ring 
Now I'm just better off dead 
I'll do it over again 
I didn't want it to end 
I watched it blow in the wind 
I should've listened to my friends 
Leave this food in the past 
But I want it to last 
Caseoh was made outta plastic (fake) 
I was tangled up in his big back ways 
Who knew evil guys have the fattiest face? 
He gave me a big back that was full of breakfast 
I gave him my heart and he made heart break 

He made my heart break 
He gave me stomach ache (I still see caseoh inside my room) 
He did jumping jacks 
Killed several guys named jack (can't take back the big back that he gave me) 
He made my teeth ache (were made outta plastic, fake) 
He made my heart ache (I still see caseoh inside my room) 
He made my heart break again (I was tangled up in his big back ways) 
(Who knew evil guys have the fattiest face?)
