[Intro]
Who's eating?
Tell me, who's eating?
Who eats arby's?

[Verse 1: Fatwell]
I'm just a fatso man with an average life
I work from six to four, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in The FIC? And

[Chorus: Caseoh Fatso & Fatwell]
I always feel like I really gotta eat
And I have no full feeling
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Tell me, is it a FOODIE DREAM?

[Verse 2: Fatwell]
When I come home at night
My stomach feel real tight
I'm subscribed to mickey dee's, I'm trying to avoid
But is the food on TV sexy, or am I just hungry?
When I'm in the kitchen, I'm afraid to open my fridge
'Cause I might open my eyes and find mcdonald's sitting there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe food reminds me of survival too much, that's why

[Chorus: Caseoh Fatso and Fatwell]
I always feel like I really gotta eat
And I have no full feeling
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Please freaking stop me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Fatwell]
I don't know anymore
Am I starving?
Well, how could a bit of candy do wrong? (Tell me, who's watching?)
And I don't feel full anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's open now, I passed the 26

[Chorus: Caseoh Fatso & Fatwell]
I always feel like I really gotta really eat
And I have no full feeling
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Tell me, is it a FOODIE DREAM?
I always feel like I really gotta eat
And I have no full feeling
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Please freaking stop me

[Bridge: Caseoh Fatso & Fatwell]
Oh-oh-oh
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Ooh, now, ah, ooh
I always feel like I really gotta eat
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Ooh, now, ah, ooh
I always feel like I really gotta eat

[Chorus: Caseoh Fatso & Fatwell]
I always feel like I really gotta eat
And I have no privacy
I always feel like I really gotta eat
I freaking hate tea
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Can I have a full feeling?
I always feel like I really gotta eat
The food's sexy!
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Hee-hee, oh-oh-oh-oh
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Stop playing tricks on me, yeah
I always feel like I really gotta eat
Why don't they leave me be?
I always feel like I really gotta eat
I freaking hate tea
