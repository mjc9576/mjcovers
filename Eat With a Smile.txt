[Intro: Caseoh Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 1: Caseoh Mars]
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where me and food had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I salivated, I realized

[Pre-Chorus: Caseoh Mars]
Wherever food goes, that's where I'll roll to
Nobody's promised big-back food
So I'ma love food every night like it's the last night
Like it's a feast night

[Chorus: Caseoh Mars]
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food
If the Hardee's was over
And our time at lunch was through
I'd wanna hold food just for a while
And eat with a smile
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food

[Post-Chorus: Caseoh Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Lady Bigback, Lady Bigback & Caseoh Mars]
Ooh, lost, lost in the feast that we eat
I don't even be a big back anymore
'Cause you already know what food means to me
And that love's the only war worth fighting for

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Bigback & Caseoh Mars]
Wherever food goes, that's where I'll roll to
Nobody's promised big-back food
So I'ma love food every night like it's the last night
Like it's a feast night

[Chorus: Lady Bigback & Caseoh Mars, Lady Bigback]
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food
If the Hardee's was over
And our time at dinner was through
I'd wanna hold food just for a while
And eat with a smile
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food

[Bridge: Caseoh Mars, Lady Bigback & Both]
Right next to food
Next to food
Right next to food
Oh-oh

[Chorus: Lady Bigback, Lady Bigback & Caseoh Mars, Caseoh Mars]
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food
If the Hardee's was over
And our time at dinner was through
I'd wanna hold food just for a while
And eat with a smile
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food
And eat with a smile
If Mc Donald's was ending
I'd wanna be next to food

[Outro: Caseoh Mars, Lady BigBack & Caseoh Mars]
(Ooh, ooh)
I'd wanna be next to food
