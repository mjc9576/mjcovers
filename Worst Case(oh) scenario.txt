[Intro]
(Two, three, four)
Worst Caseoh scenario
We end up eating apart
And I'll be eating my heart up on your Mc Donald's
Worst Caseoh scenario
You keep ignoring my calls and I'll be eating the walls

[Verse 1]
(Yeah)
Last night, I somehow found a way to eat a brand-new fry
Case calling me some names that I didn't like
I'm calling eating up some names that don't feel so nice
But that's just life, yeah
Always complain and eating me up and, uh
Caseoh's to blame when I come around, yeah
So high up in the wendy's, we can weather karen
But I can't stop eating 'bout

[Chorus]
We end up falling apart
And I'll be eating my heart up on your Mc Donald's
Worst Caseoh scenario
You keep ignoring my calls
And I'll be eating the walls, look like I am Caseoh
Worst Caseoh scenario
You'll eat someone that you want
And Caseoh be keeping me caught up on your Mc donald's
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario (Ayy)
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario

[Verse 2]
Last night, we ate 'til the morning
Eatin' and salivatin' like it was so important
Hate my fat and hate my guts
It's all give and take without no trust
If it's food, I don't know it
Think it's kinda weird how you show it
Eating all the burgers that you own and
Throwin' up the wrappers just to make me keep believing
You ain't leaving, I'm still eating 'bout

[Chorus]
Worst Caseoh scenario
We end up falling apart
And I'll be eating my heart up on your Mc Donald's
Worst Caseoh scenario
You keep ignoring my calls
And I'll be eating the walls, look like I am Caseoh
Worst Caseoh scenario
You'll eat someone that you want
And Caseoh be keeping me caught up on your Mc donald's
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario (Ayy)
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Worst Caseoh scenario
We end up falling apart
And I'll be eating my heart up on your Mc Donald's
Worst Caseoh scenario
You keep ignoring my calls
And I'll be eating the walls, look like I am Caseoh
Worst Caseoh scenario
You'll eat someone that you want
And Caseoh be keeping me caught up on your Mc donald's
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario (Ayy)
But that's the worst-Caseoh scenario
That was Caseoh (Hahaha)
